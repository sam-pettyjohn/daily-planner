 - WHEN USER scrolls down, they are presented with time block for standard business hours.
 - WHEN USER views the time blocks for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past,      present, or future.
 - WHEN USER clicks into a time block, USER can enter an event.
 - WHEN USER clicks on the save button for that time block, the text for that event will be saved in local storage.
 - WHEN USER refreshed the page, the saved event persists.
